					<span class="descriptor">[Verse 1]</span><br>
					I've been staring at the edge of the water<br>
					Long as I can remember, never really knowing why<br>
					I wish I could be the perfect daughter<br>
					But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Pre-Chorus 1]</span><br>
					Every turn I take, every trail I track<br>
					Every path I make, every road leads back<br>
					To the place I know, where I cannot go<br>
					Where I long to be<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Chorus 1]</span><br>
					See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me<br>
					And no one knows, how far it goes<br>
					If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me<br>
					One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Post-Chorus]</span><br>
					Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
					Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
					Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
					Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Verse 2]</span><br>
					I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island<br>
					Everything is by design<br>
					I know everybody on this island has a role on this island<br>
					So maybe I can roll with mine<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Refrain 2]</span><br>
					I can lead with pride, I can make us strong<br>
					I'll be satisfied if I play along<br>
					But the voice inside sings a different song<br>
					What is wrong with me?<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Chorus 2]</span><br>
					See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding<br>
					But no one knows, how deep it goes<br>
					And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me<br>
					And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?<br>

<br>				<span class="descriptor">[Bridge]</span><br>
					See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me<br>
					And no one knows, how far it goes<br>
					If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me<br>
					One day I'll know, how far I'll go<br>
					<br>
