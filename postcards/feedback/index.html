		<h1>Discussion Points / Topics</h1>
			<h2>Aesthetic</h2>

				<li>Consider upping the point size on the mobile versions, especially Tyrion's.
				<li>Since this is a display font I'm not sure if it has other weights, but a bold might be more legible too.
				<li>All the imagery and design choices support the text and concept
				<li>Not sure if you need the quotation marks, they're really small and look like dots. If you changed the color/size/something else of the character's name to make the two things different it would read a lot better

			<h2>Structure</h2>
				<li>The design's priority is definitely the image, which has been treated well.
				<li>Everything's working in complement with each other
				<li>The design should be fine in a variety of browser widths, because of the gradient background.

			<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
				<li>The images have all been treated and the edges have been considered
				<li>Since it's a webfont it should be fine, otherwise it would have to be an image instead.
